Project Ideas
Project 1: The Sleeping Teaching Assistant:
A university computer science department has a teaching assistant ( TA ) who helps undergraduate students
with their programming assignments during regular office hours. The TA ’s office is rather small and has room
for only one desk with a chair and computer. There are three chairs in the hallway outside the office where
students can sit and wait if the TA is currently helping another student. When there are no students who
need help during office hours, the TA sits at the desk and takes a nap. If a student arrives during office hours
and finds the TA sleeping, the student must awaken the TA to ask for help. If a student arrives and finds the number of disks in the TA’s room (aka no. of TAs), number of chair for waiting
students and number of students that have questions should be provided as an input to your program.
